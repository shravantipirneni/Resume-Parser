Resume Parser
Overview
The Resume Parser is a Python-based tool designed to automatically extract key information from resumes. The parser aims to simplify the process of reading and analyzing resumes by identifying and pulling out crucial data such as contact information, work experience, education, skills, and more. This tool can be useful for recruiters, HR professionals, and software engineers developing job application systems.

Features
Contact Information Extraction: Identifies and extracts names, email addresses, phone numbers, and LinkedIn URLs.
Work Experience Parsing: Detects job titles, companies, and employment dates from the resume.
Education Information: Extracts educational background, including degrees, institutions, and graduation dates.
Skills Extraction: Finds relevant technical and soft skills based on predefined skill sets or patterns.
Customizable Parsing: The parser can be easily customized to target specific resume formats or additional sections like certifications or projects.
